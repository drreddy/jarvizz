Apart from studies, I love web based programming using php, javascript, HTML, CSS. I am good at figuring out the back end part of the web programming but still far behind designing the front end part. Apart from Web based works on php, I have major interest in other programming languages like C, Ruby on Rails, C#, C++ and Algorithms Design and Analysis.
